                        <p>Hey, my name is Charity Baylor and I am currently a SICTC student in computer science. I am also a senior at Gibson Southern High School currently working for academic honors. During the past four years in high school I have been in Sunshine Society, Beta Club, FCCLA, band, and tennis. That is just inschool. Out of school I am in 4-h, I help out with my church with the computer, and I also work. I have been working at R'z Cafe and Catering for the past four years as a busser but I have done a little bit of everything from expoing, to serving food, from washing dishes, catering, and taking a table. Finally there is my family, I have an older sister named Shelby who is married to Lija, I have an older brother named Jt, then there is my mom Anita, and my dad John.</p><!-- my text for the bio -->

                    <div id="famhero"></div> <!-- this sets the parameters for my picture and displays it next to bio -->
                    <div id="futurehero"></div>  <!-- the picture for future and setting parameters for it -->
                    <div class="future">  <!-- this is the text background color and setting parameter of it  -->
                        <h3>Future plans</h3> <!-- name of the section -->
                        <p>After I graduate high school, I am planning to go to Ivy Tech for General Studies. While going to school I will also be working at Parrish Consulting Services. But after my two years are done at Ivy Tech, I am planning on transfering to Missouri Southern State University for a digital forensic degree. Eventually when I am done with school I am wanting to either work at a comapany or for the FBI.</p> <!-- text for the section -->
